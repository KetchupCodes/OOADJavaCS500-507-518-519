# Synopsis

- The proposed project is a web-based application that allows users to take a quiz consisting of five questions. 
- The application uses the React front-end framework and the Spring Boot back-end framework to build a responsive, scalable, and secure platform.
- The user first needs to login to the website using their username and password. Once logged in, the user can start the quiz. 
- The quiz is generated based on the user's preferred difficulty level: easy, medium, or hard. 
- The questions are fetched from the OpenAI API called DALLE, which uses natural language processing (NLP) to generate questions.
- The user reads the question and selects their answer from the available choices. 
- After answering all five questions, the user submits their answers to the server for grading. 
- The server processes the answers and returns the user's score.
- The user can view their score along with the correct answers and explanations for the questions they got wrong. 
- The application also provides feedback to the user on their performance and suggests ways to improve their score.
- The project aims to provide an engaging and interactive way for users to test their knowledge and learn new things. 
- The use of NLP technology in generating questions makes the quiz more challenging and interesting. 
- The application's responsive and scalable design ensures that users can access the quiz from any device and that the system can handle multiple users simultaneously. 
- The security features of the Spring Boot framework ensure that user data is protected and that the application is safe to use.
